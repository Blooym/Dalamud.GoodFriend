  "Punchline": "Improvements to the in-game friend system, including login and logout notifications for your friends, and more.",
  "Description": "Key Features:\n- Send and receive notifications when your friend using GoodFriend log in and log out.\n- Chat messages showing how many of your friends are online when you log in.\n\nDevelopers note on using this plugin after 7.0:\nAs of Patch 7.0 some data GoodFriend uses to identify players in events has become available to everyone who is nearby your character in-game, not just your friends and party members; GoodFriend itself will still only show notifications for people you have added on your in-game friends list, but please only use this plugin if you're comfortable with your login/logout events being theoretically visible to people not on your friends list.",
